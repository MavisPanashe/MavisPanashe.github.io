This module covers techniques and tools for analyzing and interpreting large datasets, including methods for handling structured and unstructured data, data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning.

## Learning Outcomes:
1. Identify and manage challenges, security issues and risks, limitations and opportunities in data wrangling.
2. Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (involving preparing, cleaning, exploring, creating, optimising and evaluating big data) to solve them.
3. Design, develop and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments using relevant programming paradigms.
4. Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

## e-Portfolio
### Project 1: Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries 
<strong>Description:</strong> The Data Collection Process. In this discussion, I critically evaluated the rationale behind the Internet Of Things (IOT), in the context of the article by Huxley et al (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection. Please review Initial and Summary post on the Collaborative Discussion Forum.

<strong>Summary:</strong> Although I did not receive feedback from peers in this project discussion, reading insights from my peers' intial posts enabled me to improve my summary post. My peers had used real life case studies to improve their discussions so I did this as a form of feedback. I used to recent case study from Volvo Cars to further expand my summary. This project taught me to broaden my perspective on a large-scale process of data collection. An improvement that I would make is going into depth about this process in the chosen case study from Volvo Cars.
